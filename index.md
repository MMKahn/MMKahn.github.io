## About Me
I am a graduate assistant at North Carolina State University and a student in their Master of International Studies Program.  I am currently also working toward two graduate certificates in Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and Applied Statistics and Data Management.   I received my bachelor's degree in History-Social Science Education Illinois State University in Bloomington-Normal, IL.  I had always been in-tune when the news would cover the danger of the Earth’s environmental changes, but it wasn’t until I taught Advanced Placement Human Geography that I began to truly understand the vast ecological, economic, humanitarian impacts climate change is having on our planet. After teaching my students to follow their dreams for years in the suburbs of Chicago, I have come to North Carolina State to do the same.  As an educator of the social sciences, I taught my students to become engaged global citizens.  Chasing that standard, my goal for the future is to work toward environmental conservation through data analysis.
